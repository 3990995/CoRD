## Dev Status
Development has been slow on CoRD for a long time. Eventually, we will be transition to [FreeRDP](http://freerdp.com) and development will speed up after that transition. Sorry, no timetables at the moment.

## Reporting Bugs
Please use GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/dorianj/CoRD/issues).

## Nightly Builds
We've made changes so infrequently since then that we've stopped doing nightly builds. If you would like to setup a build server, we would be happy to link it.
