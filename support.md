## Getting Help
**Built In** — CoRD has a built-in help system which has answers for many common questions. Access it from the Help menu within CoRD.  
**Support Forum** — If you can't get CoRD to do what you want, please post on the forum. CoRD developers monitor the forum, and sometimes community members will lend a hand too. A SourceForge.net account is required to use the forum.  
**Nightlies** — Try a nightly build. There are often bug fixes and feature enhancements in the nighties that haven't made it to the released version yet. If using the latest build doesn't fix your issue, post to the forum, including build version you tried (e.g. ‘0.5.0-nightly-397’).  
**Bugs &amp; Requests** — See the [Development page](development.html).
## Requirements
CoRD works on Mac OS X 10.5 thru 10.8 and only with [Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa383015.aspx), also known as Terminal Services. VNC and the built in OS X remote desktop server aren't supported by CoRD. We currently have no plans to add VNC support to CoRD.
### Configuring Windows&reg;
To configure your Windows host, use one of these guides from Microsoft.
- [XP Pro, Server 2003](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457106.aspx)  
- [Vista, 7, 8, Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/allow-someone-to-connect-to-your-computer-remotely)  
  - Make sure to select "Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop"

### Tiger Users
If you're running OS X 10.4 (Tiger), please see [Tiger and 0.5](https://github.com/dorianj/CoRD/wiki/Tiger-and-0.5).
## Only as a last resort...
If all else fails, you're welcome to send Dorian an email: <arcadiclife@users.sourceforge.net>. Please don't send me bug reports via email: Use Trac instead. This way our whole team will be able to see and respond to your issue.
